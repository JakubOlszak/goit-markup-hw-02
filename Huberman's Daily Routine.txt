1. Get decent solid sleep on a decent basis (aligns cell circadian rhythm clocks)

2. Get (5-10mins) natural light in eyes within 1 hour of waking up - get that modulated cortisol pulse (natural big spike sets alertness, focus, mood) as early as possible in the day (otherwise a shifted cortisol pulse towards the dead zone noon time could increase anxiety, depression, and difficulty falling asleep) —- get it in early, eyes send ‘wake up’ signal to hypothalmus in brain, which sets tone for melatonin release 16 hrs later (otherwise wonder why you’re wide awake at midnight)

3. Dopamine (main role = drive, motivation, pursuit - NOT PLEASURE) ... sunlight on eyes and skin increase that, also increase in testosterone = net result = ya feel good sunshine ☺️ live that good life! Enjoy baby

4. You wake up and feel ‘I don’t wanna do this man, so tired, no energy’ — go easy, baby steps: hydrate, some light exercise, slowly slowly build up :) natural part of your amazing healthy life giving routine baby

5. (20 second—1-3mins) cold shower - become super saiyan 

6. THE AMOUNT OF PLEASURE THAT YOU EVENTUALLY EXPERIENCE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOW MUCH PAIN YOU EXPERIENCE (13:13) .. seek pain = gain pleasure / seek pleasure = get pain






So the essential takeaway is:
-Sunlight
-Hydrate
-Some exercise like a morning run or some cardio
-Cold shower
-Delay caffeine intake so the crash/Adenosine rise lines up with your bedtime
