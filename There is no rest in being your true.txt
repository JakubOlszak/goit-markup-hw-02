There is no rest in being your true self.

You just can't stop following the plan.

Your plan is your path.

You can't just start eating shit food, wasting time and resting.

Work all the time ==> plan a to plan b to plan c, and then what's next?


My entire life is work -->



if you want to win you have to
0:14
out-compete the man who's prepared to do
0:16
nothing but work is player versus player

 I have to become
1:53
more efficient so that I can get more
1:55
done within the same time frame


 I don't
2:36
get to see my talent until I've worked
2:38
so hard that I'm in the top one percent
2:40
and now I'm beating them because I have
2:42
some god-given gift we have to do the
2:43
hard work first if there's no hard work
2:45
there's no smart work


if working smart gets you a lot
2:51
done in an hour a day then you should
2:53
work smart for 12 hours a day 12 times
2:55
the work done it's player versus player
2:57
out here man it's on the street it's not
2:59
easy for every dollar you make for every
3:00
pound you take you took it from someone
3:02
else you don't make money you take money






as a man you have to do the things
4:09
you're supposed to do




 I wake up and I
4:21
decide even though I don't feel like
4:23
working I'm gonna work



if you're gonna wake
4:40
up and look in the mirror and understand
4:41
that you're absolutely crushable that you're a rabbit and that
4:44
lions exist and that's not going to
4:46
motivate you to do something about it
4:48
then you're a lost cause; you know exactly what you need to do if
4:52
you want to stay killable then stay
4:54
killable




 you need
5:23
to put systems in place you need to get
5:24
disciplined and like Justin says you
5:26
need to get a atmosphere of people
5:27
around you who are going to keep you
5:29
accountable and not make it easy for you
5:30
to continue to be a nobody.

 and then
5:32
you're going to fix your life

otherwise
5:33
you're gonna stay nobody




ignore how I feel day after day so I can
5:36
perform regardless of whether I'm sad
5:38
happy pissed off tired but I'm going to
5:41
get up and work anyway when I'm tired



 I
5:43
was instilled with a duty for a very
5:45
long time to honor my ancestors through
5:48
achievement and I was told from a very
5:50
young age that the only thing your
5:52
ancestors are interested in is
5:53
achievement

It
is your
6:26
duty to be successful 


 if you actually
6:29
try and you actually want it and you're
6:31
actually not making excuses lying
6:33
talking you're gonna get what you
6:36
want.

What do I really want??????





 if I put
6:45
myself through endless pain to end up
6:46
where I am it's very hard for me to have
6:48
sympathy on the man who's afraid of pain




 if you actually wanted it and you
7:14
actually tried you'd have it
7:16
you could have anything you want
7:17
universe is super giving if you want it
7:20
you can have it



the universe gives it to everybody
7:31
who genuinely tries



 this world's
7:35
competitive we're all competing against
7:36
each other and the majority of people
7:39
don't try


 you're not unlucky you're
8:09
breathing you're lucky the Unlucky ones
8:12
are gone



 when I was
8:20
broke I couldn't sleep


START THE WORK NOW.
